# AnimePanelCards (TBC)
A Simple panel with 6 anime characters on them. 

Languages/coding methods used: HTML/CSS/JavaScript
Panel structure was designed using HTML5; styling was applied using CSS3 including transitions and flexbox for a seamless look. Finally light Javascript was applied to make the panels clickeable. Method used was a simple addEventListener and removeActiveClasses, which on click, will make that panel active as well remove an active class away from the other panels that are not clicked on. 


The @media queries is currently giving me some issues, as this should be working correctly, but I am going to further research as to why the simple technique of "flex-wrap: flex" and "display: flex" is not working, so please disregard that section. For now, the panels only appear horizontally.
