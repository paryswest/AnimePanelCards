# AnimePanelCards
A Simple panel with 6 anime characters on them. 

Languages/coding methods used: HTML/CSS/JavaScript
Panel structure was designed using HTML5; styling was applied using CSS3 including transitions and flexbox for a seamless look. Finally light Javascript was applied to make the panels clickeable. Method used was a simple addEventListener and removeActiveClasses, which on click, will make that panel active as well remove an activity away from the otther panels that are not clicked on.
