# AnimePanelCards (TBC)
A carousel-like set of panel cards with 6 of my favorite anime characters on them.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, (React coming soon)

Panel structure was designed using HTML5; styling was applied using CSS3 including transitions and flexbox for a seamless look. Finally light Javascript was applied to make the panels clickeable. Method used was a simple addEventListener and removeActiveClasses, which on click, will make that panel active as well remove an active class away from the other panels that are not clicked on. 

## Optimizations/Future Updates
*(optional)*

- Convert project using React Framework as this project has a good deal of dependencies.
- Adding a deeper dive in to each characters story by applying modals
- May include embedded video clip of character in action
- Improve on styling and color paletter

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that there is definitely a more efficient way to put a project like this together which is the reason why my imminent future idea is to have this project re-done using the React library. I learned that color scheme matters pertaining to how a user is going to view this site. I also learned how to utilize event listeners, and higher order functions. It made for good practice, but this is still something that I am proud of.
